# Sudoku Solver

---

## Overview
This Python program implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. It provides functionality to solve one or multiple Sudoku puzzles and visualize them using matplotlib. The program allows users to input Sudoku puzzles as a 9x9 grid with empty cells represented as `None`, and it outputs the solved Sudoku puzzles along with a visualization of the solution.

## Introduction

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also called "boxes", "regions", or "blocks") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with a partially filled grid, and the player's objective is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and region contains the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once.

## Key Features
- **Sudoku Solver**: Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- **Visualization**: Provides functions to visualize Sudoku puzzles as grids with numbers, making it easier to understand and analyze the puzzles.
- **Support for Multiple Puzzles**: Allows users to input multiple Sudoku puzzles and visualize them simultaneously, both in their unsolved and solved states.

## Usage
To use the program:
1. Import the required libraries, especially `matplotlib`.
2. Define Sudoku puzzles as 9x9 grids with empty cells represented as `None`.
3. Call the `visualize_multiple_sudokus()` function with a list of Sudoku puzzles to visualize them. Specify whether the puzzles are unsolved or solved.
4. If needed, call the `solve_sudoku()` function to solve each Sudoku puzzle.
5. Call `visualize_multiple_sudokus()` again with the solved puzzles to visualize them.
